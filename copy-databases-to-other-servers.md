# Copy databases to other servers

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

Sometimes you might find it useful to copy a database from one computer to another. Reasons include testing, checking consistency, developing software, running reports, creating a mirror database, or possibly to make the database available to remote-branch operations.

There are several ways to copy a database:

- Use the Copy Database Wizard

  You can use the Copy Database Wizard to copy or move databases between servers or to upgrade a [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database to a later version. For more information, see [Use the Copy Database Wizard](use-the-copy-database-wizard.md).

- Restore a database backup

  To copy an entire database, you can use the BACKUP and RESTORE [!INCLUDE [tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements. Typically, restoring a full backup of a database is used to copy the database from one computer to another for various reasons. For information on using backup and restore to copy a database, see [Copy Databases with Backup and Restore](copy-databases-with-backup-and-restore.md).

  > [!NOTE]  
  > To set up a mirror database for database mirroring, you must restore the database onto the mirror server by using `RESTORE DATABASE <database_name> WITH NORECOVERY`. For more information, see [Prepare a Mirror Database for Mirroring (SQL Server)](../../database-engine/database-mirroring/prepare-a-mirror-database-for-mirroring-sql-server.md).
